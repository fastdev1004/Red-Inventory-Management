## Program features
### Database connection
The program connects to a database file with ".mdf" extension using MS SQL LocalDB. [Microsoft SQL Server 2014 Express LocalDB](https://github.com/kjbartel/SqlLocalDB2014-Bootstrapper) is set as prerequisite in the Setup project, but the program works with other versions of LocalDb as well. 
When the application starts first time, a small window pops up and you have to create a new database file, or connect to an existing. You can't use the program without database connection. The program automatically stores the path of the database folder and the name of the database file in the DatabaseSettings.txt file in the application folder. You can change the database connection settings under the Settings => Database menu.

### Login
The program stores usernames and encrypted passwords in the "Users" table, and the passwords are encrypted with salted SHA-256 hashing. If the "Users" table is empty at the start of the program, a small window pops up, and you have to add the first user to the database. If there is at least one user in the "Users" table, you can enter the username and the password in the login window. You can Add/Modify/Remove users under the Settings => Users menu.

### Notifications
Program sends messages to the user via Notifications in the top right corner of the screen.
The notifications are based on this [GitHub project](https://github.com/IvanLeonenko/WPFGrowlNotification)

### Tables
Every table builds up similar way in the program with the same features.
You can Add/Edit/Delete:
- Products
- Partners
- Incoming transactions
- Outgoing transactions
- Users

If you Add/Edit a record a smaller window pops up in the center of the screen. You can change the details of the record in the window, and you can save or cancel the changes with the two button at the bottom of the window.

### Lists
You can list:
- Product's stock quantities
- Partner's money transactions

## Program structure
### Entity Layer
The Entity Layer contains the classes responsible for the structure of the database tables, and the structure of the lists passed between the layers.
#### Datatable Entities
- PartnerEntity class
- ProductCategoryEntity class
- ProductEntity class
- TransactionBodyEntity class
- TransactionHeadEntity class
- UserEntity class
#### List Entities
- ProductListEntity class
- TransactionBodyListEntity class
- TransactionHeadListEntity class

### Data Layer
The Data Layer contains the classes responsible for the Database connection, and the data provider classes responsible for the consistent database state.
#### Database connection
- Database class
  - Generates and holds the connectionstring to the mdf file.
  - Contains template "linq to sql" database manipulation functions, that can be used in the data provider classes
- MyDataContext class
  - Derived from System.Data.Linq.DataContext.
  - Contains properties to get datatables easier
  - Contains template "sql" database manipulation functions, that can be used for database creation and datatable creation.
#### Data providers
- PartnerProvider class
- ProductCategoryProvider class
- ProductProvider class
- TransactionProvider class
- UsersProvider class

### Business Layer
The classes in the Business Layer are providing services used by the UI Layer and connecting the Data Layer and the UI Layer.
- DatabaseConnection class
  - Reads the default setting from the "DatabaseSettings.txt" and tries to connect to the default file when TestConnection() is called.
  - Connects the Database class in the Data Layer with the UI Layer.
- UserLogin class
  - User authentication
  - Connects the UsersProvider class in the Data Layer with the UI Layer
- ManagePartners class
  - Connects the PartnerProvider class in the Data Layer with the UI Layer
- ManageProducts class
  - Connects the ProductCategoryProvider and ProductProvider classes in the Data Layer with the UI Layer
- ManageTransactions class
  - Connects the TransactionProvider class in the Data Layer with the UI Layer

### UI Layer
The UI Layer was made by using MVVM pattern.

#### Setup database connection
- ViewModel: SetupConnectionViewModel
- View:
  - SetupConnectionWindow (Called from MainWindowViewModel constructor)
  - SetupConnectionMenuView (Called from Settings => Database)
  - SetupConnectionView

#### Login UI
  - New User
    - ViewModel: NewUserViewModel
    - View: NewUserWindow (Called from MainWindowViewModel constructor and Settings => Users table)
  - Edit User
    - ViewModel: EditUserViewModel
    - View: EditUserWindow (Called from Settings => Users table)
  - Login
    - ViewModel: LoginViewModel
    - View: LoginWindow (Called from MainWindowViewModel constructor)

#### Main Window
- ViewModel: MainWindowViewModel
- View: MainWindow

#### Tables UI
- View: TableView
  - Every table uses the same view, which contains the basic table features: Title, New-, Edit- and Delete-button
  - The middle of the view is a ContentControl, that shows different views based on the different ViewModels
- Model: TableModel\<Entity> (derived from ListModel\<Entity>)
  - This is the base class of every TableViewModel class, and it implements everything that connects the viewmodel with the TableView, except 4 abstract function, that has to be implemented in the derived classes:
    - NewItem()
    - EditItem()
    - DeleteItem()
    - RefreshList()
- Partners table
  - ViewModel: PartnersViewModel (derived from TableModel\<PartnerEntity>)
  - View: PartnersTableView (in the ContontControl of TableView)
- Product categories table
  - ViewModel: ProductCategoriesViewModel (derived from TableModel\<ProductCategoryEntity>)
  - View: ProductCategoriesTableView (in the ContontControl of TableView)
- Products table
  - ViewModel: ProductsViewModel (derived from TableModel\<ProductListEntity>)
  - View: ProductsTableView (in the ContontControl of TableView)
- Transactions table
  - ViewModel: TransactionsViewModel (derived from TableModel\<TransactionHeadListEntity>)
  - View: TransactionsTableView (in the ContontControl of TableView)
- Users table
  - ViewModel: UsersViewModel (derived from TableModel\<UserEntity>)
  - View: UsersTableView  (in the ContontControl of TableView)

##### Add/Edit table-records
- View: EditItemWindow
  - Every table uses the same edit view. A Window pops up in the middle of the screen with a(n) ADD/Save button and a Cancel Button at the bottom of the window.
  - The middle of the view is a ContentControl, that shows different views based on the different ViewModels
- Model: EditItemModel\<Entity>
  - This is the base class of every Edit*ViewModel class, and it implements everything that connects the viewmodel with the EditItemWindow, except one logical abstract function, that has to be implemented in the derived classes:
    - Save()
- Add/Edit partner
  - ViewModel: EditPartnerViewModel (derived from EditItemModel\<PartnerEntity>)
  - View: EditPartnerView (in the ContontControl of EditItemWindow)
- Add/Edit product category
  - ViewModel: EditProductCategoryViewModel (derived from EditItemModel\<ProductCategoryEntity>)
  - View: EditProductCategoryView (in the ContontControl of EditItemWindow)
- Add/Edit product
  - ViewModel: EditProductViewModel (derived from EditItemModel\<ProductListEntity>)
  - View: EditProductView (in the ContontControl of EditItemWindow)
- Add/Edit transaction
  - ViewModel: EditTransactionViewModel (derived from EditItemModel\<TransactionHeadListEntity>)
  - View: EditTransactionView (in the ContontControl of EditItemWindow)
- Add/Edit user
  - Adding and editing users are handled by the [Login UI](#login-ui)




#### Lists UI

##### List Details
